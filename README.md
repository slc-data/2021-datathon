### Stats Test 1:
- What is the test?
    - 
- Why use this test?
    - 
- What is being compared?
    - 

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is...
    - 
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is ...
    - 


#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

#### Results:
- Reject the null or fail to reject
- Move forward with Alternative Hypothesis or not 

- Summary:
    - F score of:
